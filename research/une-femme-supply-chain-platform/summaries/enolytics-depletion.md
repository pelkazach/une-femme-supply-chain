## Executive Summary

Enolytics has developed a unified wine analytics platform that combines two previously separate data streams: VIP depletion data from over 2,400 distributors across the United States, and Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) sales data from compatible ecommerce platforms. This integration creates an integrated 360-degree view of winery sales across all channels including on-premise, off-premise, tasting room, website, and wine club. The platform enables wineries to move beyond fragmented channel data by overlaying wholesale distribution metrics with DTC demand patterns, providing geographic mapping, distributor performance tracking, inventory metrics, and account-level insights down to single square mile precision. For a wine supply chain intelligence platform like Une Femme, this approach demonstrates how to unify heterogeneous data sources into actionable analytics that inform inventory planning, distributor selection, and market expansion strategy.

## Key Concepts & Definitions

- **VIP Depletion Data**: Aggregate inventory depletion information from more than 2,400 distributors across the United States. VIP (the distributor cooperative) represents "unparalleled coverage of the space" in three-tier distribution. Depletion data tracks how quickly wines move through wholesale channels, providing visibility into which products are selling and where.

- **DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) Data**: Sales data from wineries' direct-to-consumer channels including websites and wine clubs. Enolytics' DTC software is compatible with 30-40% of wineries throughout the US, capturing sales transactions that occur outside the three-tier distribution system.

- **360-Degree Sales View**: Integrated analytics spanning all sales channels: on-premise (restaurants/bars), off-premise (retail), tasting room, website, and wine club. This unified view enables wineries to correlate wholesale depletion with direct sales patterns across geographies.

- **Days on Hand / Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)**: A depletion metric tracking how many days of inventory exist at current depletion rates. Critical for supply chain planning and identifying both slow-moving inventory and potential stockouts.

- **Depletion Rate**: The speed at which wines are consumed/sold at distributor level, measured as a time-based metric (units per day/week/month). Used to project inventory sufficiency and identify trending products.

- **Weeks of Stock**: Forward-looking metric calculating how many weeks of inventory remain based on current depletion rate. Essential for proactive ordering and production planning.

- **Three-Tier Distribution System**: The wine industry's regulatory requirement that wineries distribute through licensed wholesalers (distributors) who then sell to retailers and on-premise establishments. VIP depletion data provides visibility into this critical middle layer.

- **Account Status Tracking**: Categorized account classification including new accounts, regained accounts (previously lost), and lost accounts. Tracks account status by month within distributor, market, type, salesperson, and state.

- **Geographic Mapping**: Spatial visualization capabilities including Google Profile attributes and traditional geographic dimensions, enabling identification of "can buy" accounts down to single square mile precision.

## Main Arguments / Insights / Features

### Feature 1: Unified Data Integration Architecture

Enolytics solves the critical fragmentation problem in wine sales visibility by integrating two historically separate data systems. The platform achieves an integrated 360-degree view of winery sales across all channels by connecting:

1. **VIP Depletion Feed** - Provides wholesale distribution performance data from 2,400+ distributors
2. **DTC Sales Feed** - Captures direct-to-consumer transactions from 30-40% of US wineries
3. **Cross-Channel Analytics** - Enables correlation analysis between wholesale depletion and DTC demand

This integration directly addresses a fundamental pain point in wine supply chain management: wineries previously had to manually reconcile data from multiple systems to understand true market demand. By unifying these sources, Enolytics enables wineries to see which products are selling through distribution and where DTC is filling gaps or cannibalizing wholesale volume.

### Feature 2: Comprehensive Inventory Metrics Suite

The platform tracks multiple complementary inventory metrics that provide different analytical perspectives:

**Core Inventory Metrics:**
- Days inventory on hand (DIO) - backward-looking measure of current inventory position
- Depletion rate - velocity of sales/consumption
- Weeks of stock - forward-looking supply duration
- Monthly inventory view - temporal breakdown by wine SKU
- Multi-dimensional drill-down - ability to analyze by SKU, market, distributor, and state

**Temporal Dimension**: Metrics are tracked by time period, enabling trend analysis to identify accelerating/decelerating depletion and inventory patterns.

**Dimensional Drill-Down**: Core metrics can be analyzed across multiple dimensions (distributor, SKU, market, state, account, salesperson), enabling root cause analysis. For example, a declining depletion rate can be traced to specific distributors, markets, or sales territories.

**Price Intelligence Layer**: The platform also provides pricing comparison visibility across account, distributor, market, and item dimensions. This enables understanding whether price positioning affects depletion rates and accounts for potential discounting by distributors.

### Feature 3: Geographic and Distributor-Level Insights

The platform provides sophisticated geographic visualization capabilities that enable strategic market analysis:

**Distributor Performance Metrics:**
- Top performers ranked by accounts, distributors, and markets
- Account status categorization (new, regained, lost) tracked by distributor, market, type, salesperson, and state
- Monthly account status trends showing account movement between categories

**Geographic Visualization:**
- VIP attributes (distributor-level characteristics) overlaid on geographic maps
- Google Profile attributes (location data) enabling "can buy" account identification down to single square mile precision
- DTC demand heatmaps overlay showing consumer interest patterns
- Identification of gaps: "wholesale accounts where their wines are not yet sold"
- Identification of opportunities: "consumer interest hotspots in direct sales relative to underperforming three-tier distribution regions"

**Strategic Application**: The geographic mapping directly enables gap analysis - wineries can identify geographic markets where they have strong DTC demand but weak wholesale penetration, or conversely, where wholesale is underperforming relative to consumer interest. This informs distributor development strategy, pricing strategy, and targeted sales efforts.

### Feature 4: Combined DTC/Wholesale Channel Analysis

The platform enables comparative analysis of sales performance across channels:

**Combined Metrics:**
- DTC case sales by channel and month
- Wholesale case sales by distributor and month
- Comparative performance showing which channels are driving volume and profitability
- Channel attribution enabling understanding of sales mix

**Overlay Analysis**: By overlaying DTC data with wholesale depletion, wineries can understand:
1. Whether DTC success correlates with wholesale success (positive correlation suggests strong brand momentum)
2. Whether DTC cannibalizes wholesale (negative correlation might indicate customer substitution)
3. Geographic variations in channel performance

**Practical Application**: This enables wineries to optimize channel strategy, understand which distributors are complementary vs. competitive with DTC, and identify geographic markets where channel mix optimization could improve total volume.

## Methodology / Approach

Enolytics' approach to wine analytics combines several methodological components:

**Data Integration Method:**
1. Enolytics provides DTC software compatible with major wine ecommerce platforms (30-40% adoption suggests integration with platforms like WineDirect, Commerce7, and others)
2. Enolytics maintains data integration partnerships with VIP (the distributor cooperative) enabling direct access to depletion data from 2,400+ distributors
3. Data is normalized and combined in the Enolytics analytics platform

**Analytics Architecture:**
1. **Dimensional Data Model** - Metrics are tracked across multiple dimensions (SKU, distributor, market, state, account, salesperson, time period) enabling multi-dimensional drill-down analysis
2. **Geographic Information System (GIS) Integration** - Google Maps/Profile data is integrated with VIP distributor attributes to enable single square-mile account identification
3. **Temporal Tracking** - All metrics are tracked by time period (monthly minimum) enabling trend analysis and velocity calculation
4. **Aggregation/Disaggregation** - Platform enables viewing data at various aggregation levels from individual account/SKU to regional/national rollups

**Data Quality Approach:**
- VIP depletion data represents 2,400+ distributor participants, suggesting comprehensive three-tier system coverage
- DTC data comes directly from source systems (shopping cart integration), eliminating manual entry
- Account status classification (new/regained/lost) requires defined business rules for consistent categorization

## Specific Examples & Case Studies

The sources provided emphasize practical use cases without detailed case studies. However, they illustrate specific applications:

**Example 1: Gap Analysis Application**
Wineries can use the platform to "proactively identify wholesale accounts where their wines are not yet sold" while simultaneously viewing their DTC demand patterns. For instance, a winery might discover that DTC sales are concentrated in California's Bay Area, but wholesale distribution is absent from the region. This enables targeted account development with specific distributor accounts or directly with retailers.

**Example 2: Market Opportunity Identification**
The platform enables identification of "consumer interest hotspots in direct sales relative to underperforming three-tier distribution regions." For example, high DTC demand in Denver might correspond with weak wholesale penetration in Colorado, indicating a distributor development opportunity or a pricing/placement issue requiring investigation.

**Example 3: Inventory Planning Application**
A winery tracking "weeks of stock by distributor, SKU and time period" can identify which SKUs are turning slowly in which distributor territories. If a premium Cabernet shows 12 weeks of stock in Texas but 4 weeks in California, this indicates either demand variations or distributor ordering patterns that need investigation. The trend analysis (comparing multiple time periods) enables distinguishing between temporary fluctuations and structural inventory imbalances.

**Example 4: Account Management**
By tracking "account status by month within distributor, market, type, salesperson and state," managers can identify which accounts are being won, retained, and lost by territory. For example, identifying that a particular salesperson is losing 10% of accounts monthly while another is only losing 2% enables performance-based coaching and territory optimization.
